This folder contains scripts that are not included in the core framework but can be used to
enhance your mission.

The setup instructions for each script can be found in it's relevant folder.

Once you have setup the desired scripts from this folder, you should delete it from your
mission file to reduce the file size.

There is no limit to mission file size in TFD's missions, however it is recommended to keep
each mission file below 20MB.
